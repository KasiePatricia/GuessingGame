GUESSING GAME

I created a number guessing game to generate a number between the range of 1 and 2. The game prompts users for their username.
The range was set as a function parameter and prompted the player to predict the generated number within the given range. On a correct guess, the game awards the player a point and moves them to stage 2 by increasing the range limit value by 1. The range is from 1 and 3 for stage 2 and so on.
